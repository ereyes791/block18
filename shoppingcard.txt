A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

    Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:
        What should happen if the cart is empty?
        What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
        What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
    Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!

Cart Is Empty:
If the user tries to initiate the checkout process with an empty cart, they should be informed that their cart is empty.
Suggest options to continue shopping or return to the homepage.

User Account Status:
When the user begins the checkout process, they should have the option to check out as a guest or log in.
If they choose to log in, they should be prompted to enter their login credentials (username/email and password).
If they opt to check out as a guest, they should be asked if they want to create an account later (with benefits highlighted) or proceed without an account.

Steps of Checkout:
Checkout typically consists of several steps:
a. Cart Review: Display the items in the cart, quantities, prices, and a subtotal. Allow users to make changes (e.g., update quantities or remove items) at this stage.
b. Shipping Information: Collect shipping details, such as address and preferred shipping method.
c. Billing Information: Gather payment details (credit card, PayPal, etc.), billing address, and offer any promo code or discount fields.
d. Order Review: Provide a summary of the order, including products, shipping and billing details, and the total cost.
e. Confirmation: Display an order confirmation with a unique order ID and an estimated delivery date.

Missing or Glossed-Over Behaviors:
Guest Account Conversion: If a user checks out as a guest and decides to create an account later, offer a simple registration form that captures necessary information. Provide a clear option to set a password.
Error Handling: Implement user-friendly error handling, especially during the submission of payment information. Give clear feedback on what went wrong and how to rectify it.
Guest Checkout Benefits: If the user checks out as a guest, briefly mention the benefits of creating an account (e.g., order history, easy returns, loyalty points) to encourage account creation.
Privacy and Security: Assure users that their data is secure and explain your privacy policy.
Progress Bar: Include a progress bar to show users which step of the checkout process they're in.
Shipping Costs and Times: Display shipping options, costs, and estimated delivery times for each choice.
